You are part of an organizing team to design a large open-range Zoo for the animals listed in the below table. 
The zoo consists of sections; each section includes a group (i.e. cluster) of animals. These sections will feature 
expansive open-air houses, catering to either a single species or multiple species.
The zoo could include multiple water bodies, wooded areas â€¦etc. 
The ultimate goal is to craft a zoo that appropriate for the animals' physical and mental well-being while 
simultaneously attractive to our visitors.
